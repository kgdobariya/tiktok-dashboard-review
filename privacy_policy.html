    <h1>Privacy Policy for Personal TikTok Dashboard</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Enter Today's Date]</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how this application collects, uses, and handles data when you connect your TikTok account. This application is a personal, non-commercial tool designed solely for internal analytics.</p>
    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you authenticate with TikTok, we request access to the following information:
    - <strong>Basic User Information (`user.info.basic`):</strong> Your TikTok username, display name, and profile picture.
    - <strong>Video List and Statistics (`video.list`):</strong> A list of your public videos and their associated metadata, including view counts.</p>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The data collected is used exclusively for the following purpose:
    - To display your profile information within the application to confirm your identity.
    - To aggregate the view counts of your videos to present a total views dashboard for your own internal analysis.</p>
    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Storage</h2>
    <p>- <strong>No Public Sharing:</strong> Your data is not shared with any third parties, sold, or displayed publicly.
    - <strong>Data Storage:</strong> The application may temporarily store access tokens to maintain a logged-in session. Video statistics are fetched on-demand and are not stored long-term. All data is handled within a private, local environment controlled by the user.</p>
    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Access to the dashboard is limited to the authenticated user. All communication with the TikTok API is performed over HTTPS.</p>
    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please note this is a developer project and not a public-facing service.</p>
