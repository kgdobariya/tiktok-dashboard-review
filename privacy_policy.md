# Privacy Policy for Personal TikTok Dashboard

**Last Updated: [Enter Today's Date]**

This Privacy Policy describes how this application collects, uses, and handles data when you connect your TikTok account. This application is a personal, non-commercial tool designed solely for internal analytics.

## 1. Data We Collect

When you authenticate with TikTok, we request access to the following information:
- **Basic User Information (`user.info.basic`):** Your TikTok username, display name, and profile picture.
- **Video List and Statistics (`video.list`):** A list of your public videos and their associated metadata, including view counts.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

The data collected is used exclusively for the following purpose:
- To display your profile information within the application to confirm your identity.
- To aggregate the view counts of your videos to present a total views dashboard for your own internal analysis.

## 3. Data Sharing and Storage

- **No Public Sharing:** Your data is not shared with any third parties, sold, or displayed publicly.
- **Data Storage:** The application may temporarily store access tokens to maintain a logged-in session. Video statistics are fetched on-demand and are not stored long-term. All data is handled within a private, local environment controlled by the user.

## 4. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Access to the dashboard is limited to the authenticated user. All communication with the TikTok API is performed over HTTPS.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please note this is a developer project and not a public-facing service.
